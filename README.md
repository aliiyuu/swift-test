I would like to add a feature to Discord that allows users to accumulate a list of daily statuses that can be reacted to and commented on by other users. Users would ideally be able to choose whether this is visible to others. This would be similar to a post on most social networking sites, but it would be limited to one post per day. I believe adding a feature like this can help increase user engagement with the platform and foster connection between users.
